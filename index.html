        <p>The term "Web 2.0" was first coined by Darcy DiNucci in her 1999 article titled "Fragmented Future."</p>
        <p><i>"The Web we know now, which loads into a browser window in essentially static screenfuls, is only an embryo of the Web to come. The first glimmerings of Web 2.0 are beginning to appear, and we are just starting to see how that embryo might develop. The Web will be understood not as screenfuls of text and graphics but as a transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens. It will [...] appear on your computer screen, [...] on your TV set [...] your car dashboard [...] your cell phone [...] hand-held game machines [...] maybe even your microwave oven."</i></p>

        <center><img src="../images/oreilly.jpg"></center>
        <center><h6><i>Dale Dougherty & Tim O'Reilly</i></h6></center>
        <p>The term went unused until it resurfaced in 2002, but did not become prominent until 2004, following presentations by Tim O'Reilly and Dale Dougherty at the first Web 2.0 Conference.</p>
        <p>In the opening remarks of the conference, John Battelle and Tim O'Reilly argued that the migration to Web 2.0 creates a unique aspect that "customers are building your business for you". The activities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or pictures) could be "harnessed" to create value.</p>

        <p>"Web 2.0" refers to the cumulative changes in the way Web pages are used, rather then an update. It describes an approch, specifically the way users interact and collaberate together in a social media dialog as creators. In contrast to the past, where Websites limited people to just the viewing of content.</p>
        <p>During this era, several household names gained prominence, such as Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit.</p>

        <center><h6><i>Some recent mobile phones</i></h6></center>
        <p>The development of Web 2.0 greatly accelerated the growth of use in mobile devices. Computers took on the form of smartphones, allowing users to take photos and videos that they could instantly share at the click of a button.</p>
        <p>This "revolution" allowed people to have a nearly unlimited amount of information at their fingertips. We can even see the effect today, as the increase in social media "influencers" has taken the internet by storm.</p>
